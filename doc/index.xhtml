	<h1>Mikko's Z80 and Sinclair ZX Spectrum utilities</h1>
	<hr/>
	<h2>General information about the package</h2>
	<p>
		Mikko's Z80 and Sinclair ZX Spectrum utilities is a collection of Java
		applications which are used in emulating, testing, debugging and
		profiling Z80 processor, Z80 systems and Sinclair ZX Spectrum
		implementations. Currently (as of 2009-07-19) the package consists
		of a <a href="#testbench">Z80 test bench</a>, <a href="#spectrumemulator">
		Spectrum emulator</a> and embedded Z80
		disassembler/debugger.
	</p>
	<h2>Download</h2>
	<p>
		You may choose the version from the following table. Currently
		(as of 2009-07-19), only source package is available.
		<table border="1" summary="Download options" align="center">
		<caption>Download options</caption>
		<tr><th>Binary</th><th>Source</th></tr>
		<tr><td>-</td><td><a href="foo">mz80util-0.8.tar.gz</a></td></tr>
		</table>
	</p>
	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<p>
		The source package requires <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">
		Apache Maven</a> as a compilation tool. You may download it from
		<a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">here</a> and
		follow the <a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation">
		installation instructions</a>.
	</p>
	<h2>Installation of Z80 utilities</h2>
	<p>
		After properly configuring Maven, you may install the Z80 utilities
		package. Unzip the package by
		<pre class="example">$ zcat mz80util-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz | tar xvf -</pre>
		change directory to it by <pre class="example">$ cd mz80util-&lt;version&gt;</pre>
		and compile it by <pre class="example">$ mvn clean install</pre>
	</p>
	<h2>Testing the Z80 utilities</h2>
	<p>
		Change to Z80 test bench directory <pre class="example">$ cd testbench</pre>
		and type <pre class="example">$ mvn exec:java</pre> This should launch the
		testbench with two Z80 emulator implementations described in detail below.
		Close the testbench and change then to Spectrum directory by
		<pre class="example">$ cd ../spectrum</pre> and again type
		<pre class="example">$ mvn exec:java</pre> This should launch the Spectrum
		emulator with grayish-white background and Sinclair copyright text in it.

	<h3>General things about Z80 processor</h3>
	<p>
		It is often a somewhat difficult task to correctly emulate a processor,
		even a relatively simple one, like Z80. Although it seems simple to
		assign values to registers and memory address, there are anyway lots
		of commands and some of them affect the so-called flags register, F,
		in a strange way. Especially if one uses shortcuts and tries to
		implement a large number of commands in same <code>if</code> construct,
		for example taking advantage of syntax of <code>LD Q,R</code>
		whose binary opcode is in general <code>01QQQRRR</code> where
		<code>Q</code> and <code>R</code> are taken from the following table:
	</p>
		<table border="1" summary="Register-register load instructions"
			align="center">
			<caption>LD Q,R</caption>
			<tr><th>Value of Q or R</th><th>Register / memory pointer</th></tr>
			<tr><td>000</td><td>B</td></tr>
			<tr><td>001</td><td>C</td></tr>
			<tr><td>010</td><td>D</td></tr>
			<tr><td>011</td><td>E</td></tr>
			<tr><td>100</td><td>H</td></tr>
			<tr><td>101</td><td>L</td></tr>
			<tr><td>110</td><td>(HL)</td></tr>
			<tr><td>111</td><td>A</td></tr>
		</table>
	<p>
		Here we have multiple things to be aware of. For example the special
		value <code>110</code> which stands for memory pointer
		<code>(HL)</code> but not a register. To make things more complicated,
		if this type of command is <code>DDh</code> or
		<code>FDh</code>-prefixed, then the command reads or writes from an
		indexed memory reference, ie. the three-byte machine instruction
		"<code>DD 74 E0 </code>" stands for <code>LD (IX-20h),H </code>,
		<i>not</i> <code>LD (IX),H </code>, <code>LD (IX+E0h),H </code> nor
		<code>LD (IX-20h), IXH </code>. Without forgetting that the binary
		code <code>01110110=76h</code> stands for <code>HALT</code>, not any
		sort of load or store command at all! One therefore often needs to
		rely to a verifier, testbench or exerciser against one's own Z80
		emulator, whatever we call it.

	<h3>Z80 emulators compatible with this testbench</h3>
	<p>
		To design your Z80 emulator compatible for this testbench, there is
		just <i>two</i> requirements, it <i>must</i> implement packages
		<a href="Z80.java.txt">Z80-interface</a> and it must be declared as
		a Spring Framework bean as described below.
		There are two complete examples of such Z80 cores
		here, (a) <a href="YazeBasedZ80Impl.java.txt">YazeBasedZ80Impl</a> +
		<a href="YazeBasedALU.java.txt">YazeBasedALU</a>,
		and (b) <a href="QaopZ80Impl.java.txt">QaopZ80Impl</a>. The "Yaze"-one
		is loosely (only central ALU-functions, as the command fork in this
		one is implemented by me!) based on
		<a href="http://www.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/users/ag/yaze-ag/">
		Yaze-AG</a>, many authors, but originally written by Frank D. Cringle.
		The "Qaop"-one is based on
		<a href="http://wizard.ae.krakow.pl/~jb/qaop/">Qaop</a>, which is a
		Z80 and Sinclair ZX Spectrum emulator written by Jan Bobrowski and
		further based on "The Undocumented Z80 Documented" by Sean Young.
	</p>
	<hr/>

	<h3>Smoke-testing the testbench</h3>
	<p>
		To check that the test bench actually works and manages to print the
		code and name of the failing instruction properly, you may make a
		minor change to either one of the provided processor implementations
		(to calculate a single or couple of Z80 instruction wrong) and then
		re-compile and re-run the application. The application should halt
		with the progress bar turning red and provide a detailed message, what
		went wrong. Below is an example what happens, if
		<a href="QaopZ80Impl.java.txt">QaopZ80Impl</a>:s "CP D" command was
		corrupted like this:
<pre class="example">
 case 0xB9: cp(C); break;
 case 0xBA: /* cp(D) */ cp(E); break;
 case 0xBB: cp(E); break;
</pre>
	</p>
		<img src="testbenchfailure.jpg">MZ80TestBench after failed processor
		feature comparison.</img>
	<p>
		Note that it failed in this case to the undocumented 3 and 5 flags.
		Even if those flags were ignored it would most likely have failed to
		some other flags like the carry flag, as the test is repeated many
		times (specified in "spring-testbench.xml") per instruction.
	</p>
	<hr/>

	<h3>Wiring your Z80 emulator class into testbench</h3>
	<p>
		The testbench uses <a href="http://www.springsource.org/">
		Spring Framework</a> for dependency
		injection. There should be a file named "spring-testbench.xml", with
		a section like this:
<pre class="example">
&lt;bean id="testbench" class="org.mn.z80util.testbench.MZ80TestBench"&gt;
    &lt;property name="processor1" ref="YazeProcessor"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="processor2" ref="QaopProcessor"/&gt;
    ...
&lt;/bean&gt;
</pre>
		You should replace either one of the processors with your own
		processor's Spring bean, resembling the bean definition like this,
		found in the same file:
<pre class="example">
&lt;bean id="QaopProcessor" class="org.mn.z80util.z80.qaop.QaopZ80Impl"&gt;
    &lt;property name="ula" ref="ula"/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</pre>
		After this, you should re-compile and re-run the application.
		Note that it is possible to start your Z80 emulator from scratch
		(see MockZ80.java) and develop it command by command or command group
		by command group test-drivenly against either of the demo
		implementations.

	<h2 id="spectrumemulator">Jeccy - an open source Sinclair ZX Spectrum emulator</h2>
	<hr/>
	<p>
		Jeccy is a (currently silent) Sinclair ZX Spectrum (48K) emulator which can
		load and save Z80 and SNA snapshots. TAP or TZX tape files are unfortunately
		not currently (as of 2009-07-20) supported. To start the Spectrum emulator,
		chdir into "spectrum/" and type <pre class="example">$ mvn exec:java</pre>
		You should see the following application window appear:
	</p>
		<img src="jeccy_start.jpg" width="50%">The Spectrum main window</img>
	<p>
		You may open the disassembler/debugger by choosing "View"-&gt;"Debugger", which
		should open the following window:
	</p>
		<img src="debugger_start.jpg" width="80%">The debugger main window</img>
	<p>
		By entering start and end hexadecimal values into "Start address" and
		"End address"-fields and then pressing "Submit", you should obtain a listing
		of Z80 machine code instructions. The emulator is built in such a way that entering
		"step" mode (by "Step" button, "Continue" releases), every command not previously
		in the machine code listing is appended to the end of it. See the following
		image:
	</p>
		<img src="debugger_stepping.jpg" width="80%">The debugger in use</img>
	<p>
		As mentioned before, it is possible to load and save Z80 and SNA snapshots via
		the "File"-menu. Some of these are available in the following bundle:
		<a href="">Spectrum example games</a>.
		One of them is "Manic Miner", by Matthew Smith:
